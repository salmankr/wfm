1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,150
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,830
We had been to a bar,

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,590
nice place, and, er, I got chatting

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,950
with one of the waitresses,
and Karen weren't happy with that, so...

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,230
when we get back to the hotel,
we end up having a bit of a ding-dong,

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,910
don't we?

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,590
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,030
Wasn't a real man.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,390
- What?
- It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,110
Oh.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,150
Go on.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,390
Well... then I don't know how it happened,

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,870
but suddenly
there's a knife in my hands...

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,430
...and you know me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,950
- He learned us how to cut up a beast.
- Taught.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,190
- What?
- Taught you how to cut up a beast.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,390
Yeah, well, then I done it.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,750
- Did it.
- Did it! Stabbed her!

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,790
Over and over and over, and I looked down,
and she weren't...

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,870
...wasn't...

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,030
...moving no more.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,630
Any more.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,550
God help me, I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,870
Eh, you've gotta help me, Mr Holmes!

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,430
Everyone says you're the best.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,830
Without you...

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,350
...I'll get hung for this.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,590
No, not at all, Mr Bewick.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,990
Hanged, yes.

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,230
What the hell are you doing?!

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,710
- Bored.
- What?!

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,590
- Bored!
- No...

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,270
Bored!

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,550
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,910
- Good job I'm not one of them.
- So you take it out on the wall?

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,750
The wall had it coming.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,670
What about that Russian case?

38
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,070
Belarus? Open and shut domestic
murder. Not worth my time.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,830
Oh, shame

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,430
Anything in? I'm starving.

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,190
Oh, f...

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,350
There's a head.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,790
- A severed head!
- Just tea for me, thanks.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,190
- No, there's a head in the fridge.
- Yes?

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,470
A bloody head!

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,670
Well, where else was I supposed
to put it? You don't mind, do you?

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,270
- Well...
- Got it from Bart's morgue.

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,350
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,510
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,950
Er... yes.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,030
A Study In Pink.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,230
Nice.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,710
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,030
pink phone. There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,870
- Um... no.
- Why not? I thought you'd be flattered.

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,190
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,150
"What's incredible, though,
is how spectacularly ignorant he is

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,110
- "about some things."
- Hang on a minute, I didn't mean that...

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,950
Oh, you meant "spectacularly ignorant"
in a nice way

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,150
Look, it doesn't matter to me

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,390
- who's Prime Minister or...
- Yeah, I know.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,510
...who's sleeping with who...

63
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,630
- Whether the earth goes round the sun.
- Not that again! It's not important!

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,190
Not important...?!

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,790
It's primary school stuff.
How can you not know that?

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,190
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,110
Deleted it?

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,110
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense

69
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,310
to put things in there
that are useful. Really useful.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,550
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,910
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,390
But it's the solar system!

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,430
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,270
So we go round the sun.
If we went round the moon,

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,390
or round and round the garden
like a teddy bear,

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,790
it wouldn't make any difference!

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,470
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,910
Put that in your blog!

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,550
Or, better still, stop inflicting
your opinions on the world!

80
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,270
- Where are you going?
- Out! I need some air.

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,030
Oh, sorry, love!

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,390
Woo-hoo!
Have you two had a little domestic?

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,510
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,150
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,310
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,110
Quiet.

87
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,710
Calm.

88
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,750
Peaceful.

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,630
Isn't it hateful?

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,710
Oh, I'm sure something
will turn up, Sherlock.

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,590
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,550
Mmm. Can't come too soon.

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,910
Hey, what have you done
to my bloody wall?!

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,230
I'm putting this on your rent, young man!

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,430
- Morning.
- Oh... m-morning.

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,150
See, told you
you should have gone with the Lilo.

97
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,990
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,630
It's very kind of you.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,510
Well, maybe next time I'll let you
kip at the end of my bed, you know.

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,310
...which was
discovered quietly mouldering...

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,710
What about the time after that?

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,310
...18 months ago. Experts are hailing it

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,590
as the artistic find
of the century and no-one...

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,270
- So, do you want some breakfast?
- Love some.

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,790
Yeah, well, you'd better make it yourself
because I'm going to have a shower.

106
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,190
...It fetched over £20 million.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,150
This one is anticipated to do even better.
Back now to our main story.

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,710
There has been a massive explosion
in central London.

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,070
As yet, there are no reports
of any casualties

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,070
and the police are unable to say

111
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,110
if there's any suspicion
of terrorist involvement.

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,030
Sarah!

113
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,550
Police have issued an emergency number...

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,990
- Sarah!
- ...for friends and relatives.

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,390
Sorry! I've got to run!

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,430
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

117
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,470
I live over there.

118
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,590
Sherlock!

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,670
Sherlock!

120
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,790
John.

121
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,110
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

122
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,430
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,310
Gas leak, apparently.

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,910
- I can't.
- Can't?

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,470
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,830
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,430
How's the diet?

128
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,270
Fine.

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,990
Perhaps you can get through to him, John?

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,870
- What?
- I'm afraid my brother

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,070
can be very intransigent.

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,430
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,470
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't possibly be away

134
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,150
from the office for any length of time.
Not with the Korean elections so...

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,510
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,430
Besides, a case like this,
it requires... legwork.

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,870
How's Sarah, John?
How was the Lilo?

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,990
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

139
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,150
- Oh, yes, of course.
- How...? Oh, never mind.

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,510
Sherlock's business seems to be booming
since you and he became... pals.

141
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,110
What's he like to live with?

142
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,790
- Hellish, I imagine.
- I'm never bored.

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,790
Good. That's good, isn't it?

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,710
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.

145
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,790
Found dead on the tracks
at Battersea station this morning

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,430
with his head smashed in.

147
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,230
Jumped in front of a train?

148
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,030
Seems the logical assumption.

149
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,790
- But?
- But?

150
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,550
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.

151
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,550
Huh!

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,350
The MoD is working on
a new missile defence system,

153
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,110
the Bruce-Partington Program,
it's called.

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,630
The plans for it were on a memory stick.

155
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,790
That wasn't very clever.

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,510
- It's not the only copy.
- Oh.

157
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,070
But it is secret.

158
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,310
And missing.

159
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,590
Top secret?

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,070
Very. We think West
must have taken the memory stick.

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,470
We can't possibly risk it
falling into the wrong hands.

162
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,350
You've got to find those plans, Sherlock.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,470
- Don't make me order you.
- I'd like to see you try.

164
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,990
Think it over.

165
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,430
- Goodbye, John.
- Mm.

166
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,470
See you very soon.

167
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,230
Why did you lie?

168
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,950
You've got nothing on.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,790
Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.

170
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,390
Why did you tell your brother
you were busy?

171
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,030
Why shouldn't I?

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,710
Oh.

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,950
Nice.

174
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,270
Sibling rivalry.
Now we're getting somewhere.

175
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,950
Sherlock Holmes.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,070
Of course. How can I refuse?

177
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,750
Lestrade - I've been summoned.

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,310
Coming?

179
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,870
- If you want me to.
- Of course.

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,350
I'd be lost without my blogger.

181
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,790
You like the funny cases, don't you?

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,830
- The surprising ones.
- Obviously.

183
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,070
- You'll love this. That explosion.
- Gas leak, yes?

184
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,230
- No.
- No?

185
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,830
- No. Made to look like one.
- What?

186
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,110
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,310
A very strong box,
and inside it was this.

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,190
- You haven't opened it?
- It's addressed to you, isn't it?

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,030
We've X-rayed it.
It's not booby-trapped.

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,190
How reassuring.

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,990
Nice stationery.

192
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,070
Bohemian.

193
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,590
What?

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,190
From the Czech Republic.
No fingerprints?

195
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,790
No.

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,590
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, Meridian nib.

197
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,110
- She?
- Obviously.

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,750
Obviously.

199
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,350
That... That's the phone. The pink phone.

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,350
What, from The Study In Pink?

201
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,990
Well, obviously, it's not the same phone,
but it's supposed to look like...

202
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,590
Study In Pink, you read his blog?

203
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,230
Of course I read his blog. We all do.

204
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,110
Do you really not know that
the Earth goes round the sun?

205
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,590
It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand new.

206
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,990
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble
to make it look like the same phone.

207
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,590
Which means your blog
has a far wider readership.

208
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,590
You have one new message.

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,390
- Was that it?
- No, that's not it.

210
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,150
What in the hell
are we supposed to make of that?

211
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,070
An estate agent's photo
and the bloody Greenwich pips.

212
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,910
- It's a warning.
- A warning?

213
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,270
Some secret societies
used to send dried melon seeds,

214
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,670
orange pips, things like that - five pips.

215
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,790
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.

216
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,230
- I've seen this place before.
- Hang on.

217
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,430
- What's going to happen again?
- Boom!

218
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,070
Mrs Hudson?

219
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,790
You had a look, didn't you,
Sherlock, when you first came

220
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,390
- to see about your flat?
- The door's been opened.

221
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,310
- Recently.
- No, can't be. That's the only key.

222
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,990
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.

223
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,830
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.

224
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,710
I'd a place once when I was first married.
Black mould all up the wall...

225
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,150
Oh. Dear me.

226
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,510
Shoes.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,510
He's a bomber, remember.

228
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,310
Hello.

229
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,430
H-Hello... sexy.

230
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,830
Who's this?

231
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,910
I've... sent you... a little puzzle.

232
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,710
Just to say hi.

233
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,750
Who's talking? Why are you crying?

234
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,350
I... I'm not crying.

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,150
I'm typing.

236
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,350
And this... stupid bitch

237
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,510
is reading it out.

238
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,950
The curtain rises.

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,470
- What?
- Nothing.

240
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,630
- No, what did you mean?
- I've been expecting this for some time.

241
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,470
12 hours to solve...

242
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,470
my puzzle, Sherlock...

243
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,430
or I'm going to be...

244
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,350
...so... naughty.

245
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,110
- So, who do you suppose it was?
- Hmm?

246
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,750
Woman on the phone -
the crying woman.

247
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,030
Oh, she doesn't matter,
she's just a hostage. No lead there.

248
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,230
For God's sake,
I wasn't thinking about leads.

249
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,670
You're not going to be much use to her.

250
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,550
Are they trying to trace it -
trace the call?

251
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,230
The bomber's too smart for that.

252
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,830
- Pass me my phone.
- Where is it?

253
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,870
Jacket.

254
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,510
Careful!

255
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,230
Text from your brother.

256
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,070
- Delete it.
- Delete it?

257
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,910
Missile plans are out of the country now.

258
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,190
Nothing we can do about it.

259
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,750
Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.

260
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,110
Must be important.

261
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,550
Then why didn't he cancel
his dental appointment?

262
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,750
His what?

263
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,590
Mycroft never texts if he can talk.

264
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,030
Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans,
tried to sell them,

265
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,190
got his head smashed in for his pains,
end of story.

266
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,790
The only mystery is this -

267
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,230
why's my brother so determined to bore me

268
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,310
when somebody else
is being so delightfully interesting?

269
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,270
Try and remember
there's a woman who might die.

270
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,350
What for? There's hospitals
full of people dying, Doctor.

271
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,390
Why don't you go and cry by their bedside
and see what good it does them?

272
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,310
Ah!

273
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,430
- Any luck?
- Oh, yes!

274
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,630
- Oh, sorry. I didn't...
- Jim, hi! Come in! Come in!

275
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,150
- Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes.
- Ah.

276
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,910
- And, er... Sorry.
- John Watson. Hi.

277
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,950
Hi. So, you're Sherlock Holmes.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,870
Molly's told me all about you.
You on one of your cases?

279
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,750
Jim works in IT, upstairs.

280
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,870
That's how we met. Office romance.

281
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,910
Gay.

282
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,350
- Sorry, what?
- Nothing. Um, hey.

283
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,150
Hi.

284
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,150
Sorry. Sorry!

285
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,110
Well, I'd better be off.

286
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,830
I'll see you at the Fox.

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,430
- About sixish?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

289
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,070
It was nice to meet you.

290
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,390
You too.

291
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,270
What do you mean, gay? We're together.

292
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,950
And domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.

293
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,150
You've put on three pounds
since I last saw you.

294
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,870
- Two-and-a-half.
- No, three.

295
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,790
- Sherlock.
- He's not gay!

296
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,590
- Why do you have to spoil...? He's not!
- With that level of personal grooming?

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,750
Because he puts a bit of product
in his hair? I put product in my hair.

298
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,270
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

299
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,750
No, no - tinted eyelashes, clear signs
of taurine cream around the frown lines.

300
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,710
Those tired, clubber's eyes.

301
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,630
- Then there's his underwear.
- His underwear?

302
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,590
Visible above the waistline.
Very visible. Very particular brand.

303
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,550
Plus the extremely suggestive fact that
he just left his number under this dish.

304
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,830
I'd say you'd better break it off now
and save yourself the pain.

305
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,470
Charming, well done

306
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,830
Just saving her time. Isn't that kinder?

307
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,030
Kinder? No, no.
Sherlock, that wasn't kind.

308
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,070
Go on, then.

309
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,670
Hm?

310
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,590
You know what I do. Off you go.

311
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,030
- Oh... No.
- Go on.

312
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,070
I'm not going to stand here
so you can humiliate me

313
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,150
- while I try and disseminate...
- An outside eye, a second opinion.

314
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,590
- It's very useful to me.
- Yeah, right

315
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,830
Really!

316
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,230
Fine.

317
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,150
Oh, they're just a pair of shoes.
Trainers!

318
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,670
Good.

319
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,310
Um...

320
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,790
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,

321
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,310
except the sole has been well worn, so
the owner must have had them for a while.

322
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,430
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

323
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,790
You're on sparkling form. What else?

324
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,710
They're quite big. A man's.

325
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,190
But...

326
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,990
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

327
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,190
Adults don't write their names inside
their shoes, so these belong to a kid.

328
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,470
Excellent. What else?

329
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,110
Er...

330
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,150
- That's it.
- That's it.

331
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,790
- How did I do?
- Well, John.

332
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,750
Really well.

333
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,830
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

334
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,510
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

335
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,950
Whitened them where they got discoloured.
Changed the laces three...

336
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,870
no, four times. Even so,
there are traces of his flaky skin

337
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,270
where his fingers have come into contact
with them, so he suffered from eczema.

338
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,270
The shoes are well worn,
more so on the inner side,

339
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,790
which means the owner had weak arches.

340
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,350
British-made, 20 years old.

341
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,310
- 20 years?
- They're not retro, they're original.

342
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,550
Limited edition - two blue stripes, 1989.

343
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,270
There's still mud on them. They look new.

344
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,110
Someone's kept them that way.

345
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,190
Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles.

346
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,350
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

347
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,590
How do you know?

348
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,230
Pollen. Clear as a map reference to me.
South of the river, too.

349
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,230
So, the kid who owned these trainers
came to London from Sussex 20 years ago

350
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,470
- and left them behind.
- So, what happened to him?

351
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,310
Something bad.

352
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,030
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

353
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,070
Wouldn't let them go unless he had to.

354
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,910
So, a child with big feet gets...

355
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,990
Oh!

356
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,270
What?

357
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,350
Carl Powers.

358
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,510
- Sorry, who?
- Carl Powers, John.

359
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,310
What is it?

360
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,870
It's where I began.

361
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,310
1989, young kid, champion swimmer,

362
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,270
came up from Brighton for a school
sports tournament, drowned in the pool.

363
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,710
Tragic accident. You wouldn't remember it.

364
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,430
- Why should you?
- But you remember.

365
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,150
- Yes.
- Something fishy about it?

366
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,790
Nobody thought so.

367
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,350
Nobody except me.

368
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,550
I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

369
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,070
- You started young, didn't you?
- The boy, Carl Powers,

370
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,950
had some kind of fit in the water,

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,430
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

372
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,830
There was something wrong somewhere
and I couldn't get it out of my head.

373
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,390
- What?
- His shoes.

374
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,750
- What about them?
- They weren't there. I made a fuss.

375
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,430
I tried to get the police interested

376
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,470
but nobody seemed to think
it was important.

377
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,550
He'd left all the rest of his clothes
in his locker.

378
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,630
But there was no sign of his shoes.

379
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,550
Until now.

380
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,670
Can I help?

381
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,110
I want to help.

382
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,190
There's only five hours left.

383
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,990
It's your brother.

384
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,590
He's texting me now.

385
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,110
- How does he know my number?
- Must be a root canal.

386
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,910
- Look, he did say... national importance.
- Hmm!

387
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,310
- How quaint!
- What is?

388
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,270
You are. Queen and country.

389
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,110
- You can't just ignore it.
- I'm not ignoring it.

390
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,750
Putting my best man onto it right now.

391
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,790
Right, good!

392
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,430
Who's that?

393
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,030
John, how nice! I was hoping
it wouldn't be long. How can I help you?

394
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,830
Thank you.

395
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,550
Um, I was wanting to...

396
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,750
Your brother sent me to collect more facts

397
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,550
about the stolen plans -
the missile plans.

398
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,710
- Did he?
- Yes.

399
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,230
He's investigating now.

400
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,390
He's, er... investigating away.

401
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,310
Um, I just wondered what else
you could tell me about the dead man.

402
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,350
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

403
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,630
MI6.

404
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,390
He was involved in the Bruce-Partington
Program in a minor capacity.

405
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,150
Security checks A-OK. No known
terrorist affiliations or sympathies.

406
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,910
Last seen by his fiancée
10.30 yesterday evening.

407
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,710
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.

408
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,710
I've got to see someone.

409
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,430
Westie!

410
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,710
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?

411
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,230
- No.
- What?

412
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,670
He had an Oyster card...

413
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,110
- ...but it hadn't been used.
- He must have bought a ticket.

414
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,670
- Hm. There was no ticket on the body.
- Then...

415
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,510
Then how did he end up with a bashed-in
brain on the tracks at Battersea?

416
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,950
That is the question -

417
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,590
the one I was rather hoping Sherlock
would provide an answer to.

418
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,670
How's he getting on?

419
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,630
He's fine.

420
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,030
And it is going... very well.

421
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,510
He's, um... He's completely focused on it.

422
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,430
- Poison!
- What are you going on about?

423
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,350
Clostridium botulinum.

424
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,670
It's one of the deadliest poisons
on the planet.

425
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,750
Carl Powers.

426
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,350
Are you saying he was murdered?

427
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,110
- Remember the shoelaces.
- Mmm.

428
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,590
The boy suffered from eczema.
It would be the easiest thing in the world

429
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,750
to introduce the poison
into his medication.

430
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,110
Two hours later he comes up to London,

431
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,350
the poison takes effect,
paralyses the muscles and he drowns.

432
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,870
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?

433
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,270
It's virtually undetectable.
Nobody would have been looking for it.

434
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,630
There's still tiny traces of it
left inside the trainers

435
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,670
from where he put the cream on his feet.

436
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,790
- That's why they had to go.
- So, how do we let the bomber know?

437
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,550
Get his attention, stop the clock.

438
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,710
The killer kept the shoes all these years.

439
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,510
Yes.

440
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,230
- Meaning...
- He's our bomber.

441
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,750
Well done, you.

442
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,550
Come and get me.

443
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,550
Where are you?

444
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,590
Tell us where you are.

445
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,870
She lives in Cornwall.

446
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,310
Two men broke in wearing masks,

447
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,910
forced her to drive to the car park

448
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,150
and decked her out in enough explosives
to take down a house.

449
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,310
Told her to phone you.

450
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,630
Check the read-out from this - pager.

451
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,070
If she deviated by one word,
the sniper would set her off.

452
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,790
- Or if you hadn't solved the case.
- Oh... Elegant!

453
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,630
Elegant?

454
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,470
What was the point?
Why would anyone do this?

455
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,270
Oh... I can't be the only person
in the world that gets bored.

456
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,390
You have one new message.

457
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,910
Four pips.

458
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,990
First test passed, it would seem.

459
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,270
Here's the second.

460
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,670
It's abandoned, wouldn't you say?

461
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,310
I'll see if it's been reported.

462
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,150
Freak, it's for you.

463
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,350
Hello.

464
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,270
It's OK
that you've gone to the police.

465
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,910
Who is this?

466
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,750
Is this you again?

467
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,030
But don't rely on them.

468
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,830
Clever you.

469
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,030
Guessing about Carl Powers.

470
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,590
I never liked him.

471
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,790
Carl laughed at me

472
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,910
so I stopped him laughing.

473
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,990
You've stolen another voice, I presume.

474
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,470
This is about you and me.

475
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,470
Who are you? What's that noise?

476
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,110
It's the sounds of life, Sherlock.

477
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,510
But don't worry. I can soon fix that.

478
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,470
You solved my last puzzle in nine hours.

479
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,630
This time you have eight.

480
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,990
Great!

481
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,910
We've found it.

482
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,230
The car was hired yesterday morning
by an Ian Monkford. Banker of some kind.

483
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,350
City boy. Paid in cash.

484
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,590
Told his wife he was going away
on a business trip and he never arrived.

485
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,470
- You're still hanging round him.
- Yeah, well...

486
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,350
- Opposites attract, I s'pose.
- We're not...

487
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,710
You should get yourself a hobby.
Stamps, maybe. Model trains. Safer.

488
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,350
Before you ask, yes,
it's Monkford's blood. DNA checks out.

489
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,710
- No body.
- Not yet.

490
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,510
Get a sample sent to the lab.

491
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,830
Oh!

492
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,710
Mrs Monkford...

493
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,590
Yes. Sorry, but I've already spoken
with two policemen.

494
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,390
We're not from the police, we're...

495
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,830
Sherlock Holmes.
Very old friend of your husband's.

496
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,510
We, um...

497
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,950
We grew up together.

498
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,550
I'm sorry. Who?

499
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,390
I don't think he ever mentioned you.

500
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,550
Oh, he must have done. This is...

501
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,550
This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.

502
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,470
I only saw him the other day.

503
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,990
Same old Ian. Not a care in the world.

504
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,310
Sorry... My husband has been depressed
for months. Who are you?

505
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,230
Really strange that he hired a car.

506
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,510
Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

507
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,830
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew the tax
on the car, that's all.

508
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,310
Ah, well! That was Ian.

509
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,950
- That was Ian all over.
- No, it wasn't.

510
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,670
Wasn't it? Interesting.

511
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,510
- Who was I talking to?
- Why did you lie to her?

512
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,910
People don't like telling you things.
They love to contradict you.

513
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,470
Past tense, did you notice?

514
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,670
- Sorry, what?
- I referred to her husband

515
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,790
in the past tense.
She joined in. Bit premature.

516
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,630
- They've only just found the car.
- You think she murdered her husband.

517
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,030
Definitely not. That's not a mistake
a murderer would make.

518
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,990
- I see... No, I don't. What am I seeing?
- Fishing.

519
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,270
- Try fishing.
- Where now?

520
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,710
Janus Cars.

521
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,950
Just found this in the glove compartment.

522
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,350
Can't see how I can help you gentlemen.

523
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,270
Mr Monkford hired the car
from you yesterday.

524
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,310
Yeah, lovely motor. Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.

525
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,150
Is that one?

526
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,150
No, they're all Jags.

527
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,310
I can see you're not a car man, eh!

528
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,790
But surely you can afford one -
a Mazda, I mean.

529
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,990
Yeah, that's a fair point.
You know how it is.

530
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,430
It's like working in a sweet shop.

531
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,430
Once you start picking up the Liquorice
All sorts, when does it all stop, eh?

532
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,950
- You didn't know Mr Monkford.
- No, he was just a client.

533
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,310
He came in here
and hired one of my cars.

534
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,470
I've no idea what happened to him.
Poor sod!

535
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,190
- Nice holiday, Mr Ewart?
- Eh?

536
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,950
- You've been away, haven't you?
- Oh, the... No, it's sunbeds, I'm afraid.

537
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,950
Too busy to get away. My wife
would love it, though - bit of sun.

538
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,670
Have you got any change
for the cigarette machine?

539
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,710
What?

540
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,990
I noticed one on the way in
and I haven't got any change. I'm gasping.

541
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,030
Um... Oh!

542
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,830
No, sorry.

543
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,990
Oh, well! Thank you very much
for your time, Mr Ewart.

544
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,510
You've been very helpful.
Come on, John!

545
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,830
I've got change, if you still want to...

546
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,870
Nicotine patches.
Remember? I'm doing well.

547
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,230
- So, what was all that about?
- I needed to look inside his wallet.

548
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,470
- Why?
- Mr Ewart's a liar.

549
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,630
Hello.

550
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,430
The clue's in the name - Janus Cars.

551
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,470
Why would you be giving me a clue?

552
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,750
Why does anyone do anything?

553
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,430
Because I'm bored.

554
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,190
We were made for each other, Sherlock.

555
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,510
- Then talk to me in your own voice.
- Patience.

556
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,270
How much blood was on that seat,
would you say?

557
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,030
How much? About a pint.

558
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,870
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

559
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,030
The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

560
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,550
- Frozen?
- There are clear signs.

561
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,790
I think Ian Monkford
gave a pint of his blood some time ago

562
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,870
- and that's what they spread on the seat.
- Who did?

563
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,310
Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.

564
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,630
- The god with two faces?
- Exactly.

565
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,310
They provide a very special service.

566
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,590
If you've got any kind of a problem -
money troubles,

567
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,230
bad marriage, whatever -
Janus Cars will help you disappear.

568
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,870
Ian Monkford was up to his eyes
in some kind of trouble -

569
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,550
financial at a guess, he's a banker -
couldn't see a way out.

570
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,150
But if he were to vanish,
if the car he hired

571
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,510
was found abandoned with his blood
all over the driver's seat...

572
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,190
- So where is he?
- Colombia.

573
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,510
- Colombia?!
- Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars,

574
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,110
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

575
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,590
Quite a bit of change, too.

576
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,350
He told us he hadn't been abroad recently,

577
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,150
but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.

578
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,630
No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed.

579
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,590
- That, plus his arm.
- His arm?

580
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,870
He kept scratching it.
Obviously irritating him, and bleeding.

581
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,710
Why? Because he'd recently had
a booster jab.

582
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,910
Hep-B, probably.
Difficult to tell at that distance.

583
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,350
Conclusion - he'd just come back
from settling Ian Monkford

584
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,790
into his new life in Colombia.

585
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,910
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance,
and she splits it with Janus Cars.

586
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,390
- Mrs Monkford?
- Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

587
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,150
Now, go and arrest them, Inspector,
that's what you do best.

588
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,470
We need to let our friendly bomber
know that the case is solved.

589
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,070
I am on fire!

590
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,870
He says...

591
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,710
you can come and fetch me.

592
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,190
Help!

593
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,590
Help me, please!

594
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,830
Feeling better?

595
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,990
To be honest, we've hardly stopped
for breath since this thing started.

596
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,830
- Has it occurred to you...?
- Probably.

597
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,190
No, has it occurred to you that
the bomber's playing a game with you?

598
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,510
The envelope,
breaking into the other flat,

599
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,550
the dead kid's shoes -
it's all meant for you.

600
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,870
Yes, I know.

601
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,390
Is it him, then? Moriarty?

602
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,910
Perhaps.

603
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,390
- That could be anybody.
- Well, it could be, yeah.

604
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,430
Lucky for you, I've been
more than a little unemployed.

605
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,950
- How d'you mean?
- Lucky for you,

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,630
Mrs Hudson and I
watch far too much telly.

607
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,990
...Thank you, Tyra!
Doesn't she look lovely, everybody, now?

608
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,590
Anyway...

609
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,030
Speaking of silk purses...

610
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,070
- Hello?
- This one...

611
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,910
is a bit...

612
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,470
...defective.

613
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,630
Sorry.

614
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,950
She's blind.

615
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,510
This is...

616
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,790
...a funny one.

617
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,190
I'll give you...

618
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,310
...12 hours.

619
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,590
Why are you doing this?

620
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,550
I like...

621
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,230
...to watch you...

622
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,350
dance.

623
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,750
...And I see you're back
to your bad habits.

624
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,950
...continuing into the sudden
death of the popular TV personality

625
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,630
Connie Prince.

626
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,750
Miss Prince, famous for her makeover
programmes, was found dead two days ago

627
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,350
by her brother in the house
they shared in Ham...

628
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,630
Connie Prince, 54, she had one of those
makeover shows on the telly.

629
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,750
- Did you see it?
- No.

630
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,030
- Very popular, she was going places.
- Not any more.

631
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,430
So, dead two days.

632
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,310
According to one of her staff,
Raoul de Santos,

633
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,350
she cut her hand on a rusty nail
in the garden.

634
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,590
Nasty wound. Tetanus bacteria
enters the bloodstream,

635
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,470
good night, Vienna.

636
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,390
I s'pose.

637
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,990
Something's wrong with this picture.

638
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,270
Eh?

639
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,710
Can't be as simple as it seems,

640
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,550
otherwise the bomber
wouldn't be directing us towards it.

641
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,950
Something's wrong.

642
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,390
- John?
- Mm.

643
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,750
Cut on her hand, it's deep.
Would have bled a lot, right?

644
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,750
- Yeah.
- But the wound's clean.

645
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,310
Very clean, and fresh.

646
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,390
How long would the bacteria
have been incubating inside her?

647
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,910
Ooh, eight, ten days.

648
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,390
The cut was made later.

649
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,790
- After she was dead?
- Must have been.

650
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,950
The only question is, how did the tetanus
enter the dead woman's system?

651
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,110
- You want to help, right?
- Of course.

652
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,710
Connie Prince's background -
family history, everything, give me data.

653
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,830
Right.

654
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,670
There's something else
that we haven't thought of.

655
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,270
- Is there?
- Yes. Why is he doing this, the bomber?

656
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,150
If this woman's death was suspicious,
why point it up?

657
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,270
- Good Samaritan.
- Who press-gangs suicide bombers?

658
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,190
- Bad Samaritan.
- I'm... I'm serious, Sherlock.

659
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,990
Listen, I'm cutting you slack here,
I'm trusting you,

660
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,150
but out there somewhere,
some poor bastard's covered in Semtex

661
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,350
and he's just waiting for you
to solve the puzzle, so just tell me -

662
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,990
what are we dealing with?

663
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,350
Something new.

664
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,950
Connection, connection, connection.
There must be a connection.

665
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,750
Carl Powers, killed 20 years ago.

666
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,550
The bomber knew him,
admitted that he knew him.

667
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,830
The bomber's iPhone was in the stationery
from the Czech Republic.

668
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,590
The first hostage from Cornwall,
the second from London,

669
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,190
the third from Yorkshire,
judging by her accent.

670
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,230
What's he doing? Working his way
round the world, showing off?

671
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,750
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

672
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,390
Joining the... dots.

673
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,150
Three hours.

674
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,630
Boom... boom.

675
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,670
We're devastated, of course we are.

676
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,110
Can I get you anything, sir?

677
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,710
Er, no. No, thanks.

678
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,230
Raoul is my rock.
I don't think I could have managed.

679
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,670
We didn't always see eye to eye...
but my sister was very dear to me.

680
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,270
And to the, er, public, Mr Prince.

681
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,270
Oh, she was adored.

682
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,990
I've seen her take girls who looked like
the back end of Routemasters

683
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,390
and turn them into princesses.

684
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,990
Still, it's a relief, in a way, to know
that she's beyond this veil of tears.

685
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,670
Absolutely.

686
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,710
Great.

687
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,310
Thank you. Thanks again.

688
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,750
It's a real shame. I liked her.

689
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,990
She taught you how to do your colours.

690
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,910
- Colours?
- You know, what goes best with what.

691
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,670
I should never wear cerise, apparently.

692
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,230
- Drains me.
- Who's that?

693
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,990
- Home Office.
- Home Office?

694
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,870
Well, Home Secretary, actually.
Owes me a favour.

695
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,110
She was a pretty girl, but she
messed about with herself too much.

696
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,590
They all do these days.
People can hardly move their faces.

697
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,950
It's silly, isn't it?

698
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,710
- Did you ever see her show?
- Not until now.

699
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,590
You look pasty, love.

700
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,630
Ah, rained every day but one...

701
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,870
That's the brother. No love lost there,

702
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,030
- if you can believe the papers.
- So I gather.

703
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,030
I've just been having a very fruitful chat
with people who love this show.

704
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,110
- The fan site's indispensable for gossip.
- ...really only one thing we can do

705
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,030
with that ensemble,
don't you think, girls?

706
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,030
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off!

707
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,710
Yeah, it's more common
than people think.

708
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,590
The tetanus is in the soil,

709
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,270
people cut themselves on rose bushes,
garden forks, that sort of thing,

710
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,790
if left un... treated...

711
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,790
- I don't know what I'm going to do now.
- Right.

712
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,310
I mean, she's left me this place...
which is lovely...

713
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,390
...but it's not the same without her.

714
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,910
That's why...

715
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,790
my paper wanted to get the, erm... the full
story straight from the horse's mouth.

716
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,510
Are you sure it's not too soon?

717
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,710
- No.
- Right.

718
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,950
You fire away.

719
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,870
John.

720
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,430
Hi. Look, get over here quickly.
I think I'm onto something.

721
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,150
You'll need to pick up some stuff first.
Have you got a pen?

722
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,390
I'll remember.

723
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,510
- That'll be him.
- What?

724
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,030
- Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it?
- Yes.

725
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,230
- Very good to meet you.
- Yes, thank you.

726
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,790
- So sorry to hear about...
- Yes, yes, very kind.

727
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,470
Shall we, er...?

728
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,190
You were right, the bacteria
got into her another way.

729
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,830
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

730
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,750
- Right, are we all set?
- Er, yes. Shall we, erm...?

731
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,150
Er, not too close. I'm raw from crying.

732
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,430
Oh, who's this?

733
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,350
Sekhmet. Named after the Egyptian goddess.

734
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,550
How nice. Was she Connie's?

735
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,590
Yes, a little present from yours truly.

736
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,870
Sherlock, light reading?

737
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,430
Oh, er...

738
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,310
- Bloody hell! What are you playing at?
- Sorry!

739
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,110
You're like Laurel and bloody Hardy,
you two! What's going on?

740
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,550
Actually, I think we've got
what we came for. Excuse us.

741
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,070
- What?
- Sherlock.

742
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,710
- What?
- We've got deadlines.

743
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,670
But you've not taken anything!

744
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,350
Yes! Ooh, yes!

745
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,230
You think it was the cat.
It wasn't the cat.

746
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,110
What? Yes. Yeah, it is.

747
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,390
It must be. It's how he got
the tetanus into her system.

748
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,030
- Its paws stink of disinfectant.
- Lovely idea.

749
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,430
No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.

750
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,470
It's a new pet,
bound to be a bit jumpy around her.

751
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,510
A scratch is almost inevitable.
She wouldn't...

752
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,030
I thought of it the minute
I saw the scratches on her arm,

753
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,670
but it's too random
and too clever for the brother.

754
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,430
He murdered his sister for her money.

755
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,630
- Did he?
- Didn't he?

756
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,470
Nope. It was revenge.

757
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,670
- Rev...? Who wanted revenge?
- Raoul, the houseboy.

758
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,310
Kenny Prince was the butt
of his sister's jokes week in, week out.

759
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,710
Virtual bullying campaign. Finally,
he had enough, fell out with her badly.

760
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,430
It's all on the website.

761
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,510
She threatened to disinherit Kenny,
Raoul had grown accustomed

762
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,070
- to a certain lifestyle...
- Wait. Wait!

763
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,510
Wait a second. What about the
disinfectant, then, on the cat's claws?

764
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,950
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door,

765
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,630
saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its life.

766
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,630
You smell of disinfectant.
I know the cat doesn't come into it.

767
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,870
Raoul's internet records do, though.
I hope we can get a cab from here.

768
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,470
Raoul de Santos is your killer.

769
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,590
Kenny Prince's houseboy.

770
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,030
Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus
that poisoned Connie Prince,

771
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,990
it was botulinum toxin.

772
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,790
We've been here before.
Carl Powers. Tut-tut.

773
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,470
- Our bomber's repeated himself.
- So how'd he do it?

774
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,350
- Botox injection.
- Botox?

775
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,910
Botox is a diluted form of botulinum.

776
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,350
Among other things,

777
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,910
Raoul de Santos was employed to give
Connie her regular facial injections.

778
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,350
My contact at the Home Office

779
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,870
gave me the complete records
of Raoul's internet purchases.

780
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,630
He's been bulk ordering Botox for months.

781
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,510
Bided his time, then upped the strength
to a fatal dose.

782
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,190
- Are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

783
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,910
All right, my office.

784
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,750
- Hey, Sherlock, how long?
- What?

785
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,430
- How long have you known?
- Well, this one was quite simple.

786
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,630
And like I said, the bomber
repeated himself. That was a mistake.

787
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,590
No, but, Sherlock, the hostage, the old
woman, she's been there all this time!

788
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,030
I knew I could save her. I also knew
that the bomber had given us 12 hours.

789
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,790
I solved the case quickly, that gave me
time to get on with other things.

790
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,830
Don't you see? We're one up on him.

791
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,750
Hello.

792
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,470
Help me!

793
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,630
Tell us where you are.

794
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,270
- Address?
- He was so...

795
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,110
His voice...

796
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,750
No, no, no, no!
Tell me nothing about him, nothing.

797
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,750
He sounded so soft.

798
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,830
Hello?

799
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,790
Sherlock?

800
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,310
What's happened?

801
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,670
The explosion,

802
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,590
which ripped through several floors,
killing 12 people...

803
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,870
- Old block of flats.
- ...caused by a faulty gas main.

804
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,070
A spokesman from the utility company...

805
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,630
- He certainly gets about.
- Well, obviously I lost that round.

806
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,510
Although technically,
I did solve the case.

807
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,790
He killed the old lady
because she started to describe him.

808
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,790
Just once,
he put himself in the firing line.

809
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,230
What d'you mean?

810
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,830
Well, usually, he...
must stay above it all.

811
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,630
He organises these things,
but no-one ever has direct contact.

812
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,910
What, like the Connie Prince murder,
he arranged that?

813
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,070
So, people come to him wanting their
crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?

814
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,150
Novel.

815
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,030
Huh!

816
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,030
Taking his time this time.

817
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,990
Anything on the Carl Powers case?

818
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,230
Nothing.

819
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,550
All the living classmates check out
spotless, no connection.

820
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,710
- Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
- The thought had occurred.

821
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,350
So why is he doing this, then?

822
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,070
Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught?

823
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,510
- I think he wants to be distracted.
- Oh...

824
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,470
I hope you'll be very happy together.

825
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,950
- Sorry, what?
- There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

826
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,070
Actual human lives! Just so I know,

827
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,230
- do you care about that at all?
- Will caring about them help save them?

828
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,310
Nope.

829
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,630
Then I'll continue not
to make that mistake.

830
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,070
- And you find that easy, do you?
- Yes, very.

831
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,750
- Is that news to you?
- No, no.

832
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,350
I've disappointed you.

833
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,710
That's good,
that's a good deduction, yeah.

834
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,630
Don't make people into heroes, John.

835
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,950
Heroes don't exist, and if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

836
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,950
Excellent.

837
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,830
A view of the Thames.

838
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,190
South Bank, somewhere between
Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

839
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,230
You check the papers,
I'll look online.

840
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,230
Oh, you're angry with me,
so you won't help.

841
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,710
Not much cop, this caring lark.

842
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,430
- Archway suicide...
- Ten-a-penny.

843
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,510
Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.

844
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,190
Ah, man found on the train line,
Andrew West.

845
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,710
Nothing!

846
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,630
It's me. Have you found anything
on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge

847
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,150
and Southwark Bridge?

848
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,590
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

849
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,270
Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.

850
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,590
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

851
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,950
Yes.

852
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,270
- Any ideas?
- Seven, so far.

853
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,790
Seven?

854
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,750
He's dead about 24 hours.

855
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,270
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?

856
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,590
Apparently not. Not enough of the Thames
in his lungs, asphyxiated.

857
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,190
Yes, I'd agree.

858
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,510
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

859
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,310
More bruises...

860
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,590
here and here.

861
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,830
Fingertips.

862
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,830
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.

863
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,630
He's been in the river a long while,
the water's destroyed most of the data.

864
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,710
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

865
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,790
- What?
- We need to identify the corpse,

866
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,310
find out about his friends and...

867
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,790
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What painting? What are you on about?

868
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,950
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?

869
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,590
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.

870
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,190
Now it's turned up, worth £30 million.

871
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,910
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?

872
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,550
Everything.

873
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,310
- Have you ever heard of the Golem?
- Golem?

874
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,790
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

875
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,750
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made of
clay, it's also the name of an assassin.

876
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,910
Real name - Oskar Dzundza. One of
the deadliest assassins in the world.

877
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,870
That is his trademark style.

878
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,790
- So this is a hit?
- Definitely.

879
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,030
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

880
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,870
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

881
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,550
You do see, you just don't observe!

882
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,270
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

883
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,550
Sherlock, do you want
to take us through it?

884
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,150
What do we know about this corpse?

885
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,670
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

886
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,910
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.

887
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,870
The trousers are heavy duty. Polyester,
nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.

888
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,670
They're both too big for him.
So some kind of standard-issue uniform.

889
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,430
Dressed for work, then. What kind of work?

890
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,230
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

891
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,030
Tube driver?

892
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,710
- Security guard?
- More likely.

893
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,790
- That'll be borne out by his backside.
- Backside?!

894
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,030
Flabby, you'd think
he led a sedentary life.

895
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,590
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent
varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.

896
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,350
So, a lot of walking
anda lot of sitting around.

897
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,790
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

898
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,870
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

899
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,510
Why regular? Maybe he set his alarm
like that the night before he died?

900
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,750
No, no, no. The buttons
are stiff, hardly touched.

901
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,270
He set his alarm like that a long time
ago, his routine never varied.

902
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,030
But there's something else.
The killer must have been interrupted,

903
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,670
otherwise he would have stripped
the corpse completely.

904
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,830
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front

905
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,110
that he tore off, suggesting the dead man
works somewhere recognisable,

906
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,750
some kind of institution.

907
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,510
I found this inside his trouser pockets.

908
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,310
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

909
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,750
- Tickets?
- Ticket stubs.

910
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,590
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.

911
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,310
The Hickman Gallery has reported
one of its attendants as missing,

912
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,830
Alex Woodbridge.

913
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,710
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

914
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,910
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem

915
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,110
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

916
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,310
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,

917
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,310
something that would stop the owner
getting paid £30 million.

918
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,110
- The pictures are fake.
- Fantastic.

919
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,910
- Meretricious.
- And a Happy New Year.

920
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,470
Poor sod.

921
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,510
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

922
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,070
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

923
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,270
- Who?
- Me.

924
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,190
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

925
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,110
- Waterloo Bridge.
- Where now, the gallery?

926
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,990
In a bit.

927
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,950
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

928
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,590
Why have they got hold
of an old master?

929
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,670
Don't know.
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

930
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,110
Need data...

931
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,390
Stop!

932
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,590
Can you wait here?

933
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,670
I won't be a moment.

934
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,190
Sherlock?

935
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,870
Change? Any change?

936
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,750
- What for?
- Cup of tea, of course.

937
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,070
Here you go, a 50.

938
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,790
Thanks.

939
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,070
- What are you doing?
- Investing.

940
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,990
Now we go to the gallery.

941
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,510
Have you got any cash?

942
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,350
No, I need you to find out all you can
about the gallery attendant.

943
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,270
- Lestrade will give you the address.
- OK.

944
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,750
We'd been sharing about a year.

945
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,430
- Just sharing.
- Mmm.

946
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,310
- May I?
- Yeah.

947
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,150
Sorry.

948
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,870
Stargazer, was he?

949
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,710
God, yeah. Mad about it.

950
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,430
It's all he ever did in his spare time.

951
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,910
He was a nice guy, Alex.

952
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,870
I liked him.

953
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,270
He was, er...

954
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,430
never much of a one for hoovering.

955
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,670
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

956
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,230
It was just a job, you know?

957
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,430
Mmm.

958
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,430
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

959
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,710
No.

960
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,110
We had a break-in, though.

961
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,990
- When?
- Last night.

962
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,070
There was nothing taken.

963
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,990
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

964
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,310
- Who was it from?
- I can play it for you, if you like.

965
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,590
- I'll get the phone...
- Please.

966
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,270
Oh, should I speak now? Alex?

967
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,030
Love, it's Professor Cairns.

968
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,070
Listen, you were right.
You were bloody right.

969
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,310
Give us a call when...

970
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,110
Professor Cairns?

971
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,230
- No idea, sorry.
- Mmm.

972
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,510
Can I try and ring back?

973
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,190
No good. I've had other calls since.
Sympathy ones, you know.

974
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,070
Don't you have something to do?

975
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,030
Just admiring the view.

976
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,750
Yes.

977
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,350
Lovely. Now go back to work -
we open tonight.

978
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,030
- Doesn't it bother you?
- What?

979
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,390
That the painting's a fake.

980
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,550
- What?
- It's a fake. It has to be.

981
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,270
It's the only possible explanation.

982
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,550
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas?

983
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,790
Who are you?

984
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,910
Alex Woodbridge knew
that the painting was a fake,

985
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,790
so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

986
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,750
Golem? What the hell
are you talking about?

987
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,510
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

988
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,030
It's not a fake.

989
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,790
It is a fake.

990
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,070
I don't know why. But there's something
wrong with it, there has to be.

991
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,790
What the hell are you on about?
You know I could have you

992
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,110
- sacked on the spot.
- Not a problem.

993
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,910
- No?
- No, I don't work here, you see.

994
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,230
Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

995
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,950
How did you get in?

996
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,110
- Please!
- I want to know.

997
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,430
The art of disguise is knowing
how to hide in plain sight.

998
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,350
- Who are you?
- Sherlock Holmes.

999
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,790
Am I supposed to be impressed?

1000
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,990
You should be.

1001
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,590
Have a nice day.

1002
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,950
He wouldn't. He just wouldn't.

1003
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,310
- Stranger things have happened.
- Westie wasn't a traitor.

1004
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,030
It's a horrible thing to say!

1005
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,910
I'm sorry.
But you must understand...

1006
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,550
That's what they think,
isn't it, his bosses?

1007
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,190
He was young man,
about to get married, he had debts.

1008
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,350
Everyone's got debts,

1009
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,230
and Westie wouldn't want to clear them
by selling out his country.

1010
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,550
Can you, erm...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

1011
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,670
We were having a night in.

1012
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,990
Just... watching a DVD.

1013
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,110
He normally falls asleep, you know,
but he sat through this one.

1014
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,510
He was quiet.

1015
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,950
Out of the blue he said he just
had to go and see someone.

1016
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,510
And you've no idea who?

1017
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,870
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

1018
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,030
- Yeah.
- Who's this?

1019
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,670
- John Watson, hi.
- This is my brother, Joe.

1020
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,910
John's trying to find out
what happened to Westie, Joe.

1021
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,230
- You with the police?
- Sort of, yeah.

1022
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,150
Tell them to get off their arses,
will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

1023
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,670
I'll do my best.

1024
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,870
Well, er,

1025
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,710
thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

1026
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,350
He didn't steal those things,
Mr Watson.

1027
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,710
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

1028
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,230
He was my good man.

1029
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,310
- Spare change?
- No.

1030
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,750
Any spare change?

1031
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,070
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

1032
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,710
- And?
- And...

1033
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,270
Is that it?
No habits, hobbies, personality?

1034
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,550
Give us a chance.
He was an amateur astronomer.

1035
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,670
- Hold that cab.
- Spare change, sir?

1036
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,190
- Don't mind if I do.
- Can you wait here?

1037
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,310
Fortunately, I haven't been idle.
Come on.

1038
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,910
Beautiful, isn't it?

1039
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,470
- I thought you didn't care about...
- Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

1040
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,270
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had
a message on the answer phone at his flat.

1041
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,310
- A Professor Cairns.
- This way.

1042
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,710
Nice. Nice part of town.

1043
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,790
- Any time you want to explain?
- Homeless network.

1044
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,910
- Really is indispensable.
- Homeless network?

1045
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,510
My eyes and ears,
all over the city.

1046
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,350
Ah, that's... clever.

1047
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,270
- So you scratch their backs, and...?
- Yes, then disinfect myself.

1048
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,030
Sherlock! Come on!

1049
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,990
What's he doing sleeping rough?

1050
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,350
Well, he has a very distinctive look.
He has to hide somewhere

1051
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,710
where tongues won't wag... much.

1052
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,910
- Oh...
- What?

1053
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,110
- I wish I...
- Don't mention it.

1054
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,870
No! No! No! No!

1055
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,710
It'll take us weeks to find him again.

1056
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,310
Or not. I have an idea
where he might be going.

1057
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,230
- What?
- I told you,

1058
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,070
someone left Alex Woodbridge
a message.

1059
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,990
There can't be that many
Professor Cairns in the book. Come on.

1060
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,910
Jupiter, the fifth planet
in our solar system, and the largest.

1061
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,350
Jupiter is a gas giant. Planet Earth
would fit into it 11 times.

1062
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,430
Yes, we know that.

1063
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,350
- Titan is the largest moon...
- Come on, Neptune.

1064
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,470
Many are actually long dead...

1065
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,510
- Tom, is that you?
- ...exploded into supernovas.

1066
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,310
Discovered by Urban Le Terrier in 1846...

1067
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,190
...composed mainly of hydrogen.

1068
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,070
Their light takes so long to reach us...

1069
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,470
- Golem!
- ...many are actually long dead,

1070
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,710
exploded into...

1071
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,190
I can't see him.

1072
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,990
- I'll go round.
- Who are you working for, Dzundza?

1073
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,990
A star begins
as a collapsing ball of material

1074
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,150
- composed mainly of...
- Golem!

1075
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,070
Let him go...

1076
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,630
or I will kill you.

1077
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,190
The fourth planet of the solar system,
named after the Roman God of War.

1078
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,790
...It is a gas giant...

1079
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,510
...takes so long to reach us...

1080
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,150
...into supernovas...

1081
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,630
...exploded into supernovas...

1082
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,470
- It's a fake. It has to be.
- That painting has been subjected to

1083
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,030
- every test known to science.
- It's a very good fake, then.

1084
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,950
You know about this, don't you?
This is you, isn't it?

1085
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,630
Inspector, my time is being wasted.

1086
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,830
Would you mind showing yourself
and your friends out?

1087
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,710
The painting is a fake.

1088
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,190
It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge
and Cairns were killed.

1089
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,350
Oh, come on, proving it's just a detail.
The painting is a fake.

1090
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,310
I've solved it, I've figured it out.

1091
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,670
It's a fake, that's the answer,
that's why they were killed.

1092
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,510
OK, I'll prove it. Give me time.
Will you give me time?

1093
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,870
- 10...
- It's a kid.

1094
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,030
- Oh God, it's a kid.
- What did he say?

1095
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,070
- 10.
- 9.

1096
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,190
He's giving me time.

1097
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,990
- Jesus...
- It's a fake, but how can I prove it?

1098
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,950
- How?! How?!
- 8.

1099
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,070
This kid will die. Tell me
why the painting is a fake. Tell me!

1100
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,110
- 7.
- No, shut up.

1101
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,390
Don't say anything.
It only works if I figure it out.

1102
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,830
It must be possible.
It must be staring me in the face.

1103
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,390
- 6.
- How?

1104
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,630
Woodbridge knew, but how?!

1105
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,750
- 5.
- It's speeding up! Sherlock!

1106
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,710
- 4.
- In the Planetarium, you heard it too.

1107
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,750
Oh, that is brilliant,
that is gorgeous!

1108
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,390
- 3.
- What's brilliant? What is?!

1109
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,670
This is beautiful.

1110
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,630
2.

1111
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,230
- Sherlock!
- The Van Burne Supernova.

1112
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,430
Please, is somebody there?
Somebody help me.

1113
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,830
There you go. Go and find out
where he is and pick him up.

1114
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,590
Van Burne Supernova, so-called.

1115
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,790
Exploding star.
Only appeared in the sky in 1858.

1116
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,830
So how could it have been...

1117
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,830
painted in the 1640s?

1118
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,550
Oh...

1119
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,070
Oh.

1120
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,470
Oh, Sheryl...

1121
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,910
You know, it's interesting.
Bohemian stationery,

1122
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,390
an assassin named after a Prague legend,
and you, Miss Wenceslas.

1123
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,470
This whole case has a distinctly
Czech feeling about it.

1124
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,990
Is that where this leads?

1125
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,710
What are we looking at, Inspector?

1126
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,430
Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud,

1127
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,710
accessory after the fact,
at the very least.

1128
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,070
The murder of the old woman,
all the people in the flat...

1129
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,470
I didn't know anything about that.

1130
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,150
All those things, please, believe me.

1131
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,950
I just wanted my share.

1132
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,470
The 30 million.

1133
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,270
I found a little old man in Argentina.

1134
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,110
A genius - I mean, really.

1135
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,030
Brushwork, immaculate.

1136
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,670
- Could fool anyone.
- Mmm.

1137
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,190
Well, nearly anyone.

1138
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,430
But I didn't know how to go about
convincing the world

1139
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,910
the picture was genuine.

1140
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,710
It was just an idea.

1141
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,870
A spark which he blew into a flame.

1142
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,630
Who?

1143
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,150
I don't know.

1144
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,790
It's true!

1145
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,470
It took a long time,
but eventually I was...

1146
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,270
put in touch with people.

1147
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,950
His people...

1148
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,710
Well, there was never any real contact.

1149
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,590
Just messages...

1150
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,710
...whispers.

1151
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,990
And did those whispers have a name?

1152
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,950
Moriarty.

1153
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,910
- So this is where West was found?
- Yeah.

1154
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,230
- Are you going to be long?
- I might be.

1155
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,230
- Are you the police, then?
- Sort of.

1156
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,070
- I hate 'em.
- The police?

1157
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,670
No, jumpers.

1158
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,390
People who chuck 'emselves
in front of trains. Selfish bastards.

1159
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,190
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

1160
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,670
I mean it. It's all right for them.

1161
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,630
It's over in a split second,
strawberry jam all over the lines.

1162
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,670
What about the drivers, eh?

1163
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,830
They've got to live with it, haven't they?

1164
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,790
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam,
there's no blood on the line.

1165
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,470
- Has it been cleaned off?
- No, there wasn't that much.

1166
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,990
You said his head was smashed in.

1167
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,030
It was, but there wasn't much blood.

1168
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,590
- OK.
- Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

1169
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,990
- Just give us a shout when you're off.
- Right.

1170
01:12:53,040 --> 01:13:00,790
Right, so, Andrew West...
got on the train somewhere. Or did he?

1171
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,510
There was no ticket on the body.

1172
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,910
How did he end up here?

1173
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,830
- The points.
- Yes!

1174
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,070
I knew you'd get there eventually.

1175
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,670
West wasn't killed here,
that's why there was so little blood.

1176
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,990
- How long have you been following me?
- Since the start.

1177
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,870
You don't think
I'd give up on a case like this

1178
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,750
just to spite my brother, do you?

1179
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,230
Come on,
we've got a bit of burglary to do.

1180
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,550
Missile defence plans
haven't left the country,

1181
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,150
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

1182
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,510
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.

1183
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,710
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

1184
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,270
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it

1185
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,870
or doesn't know what to do with it.

1186
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,830
My money's on the latter.

1187
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,390
We're here.

1188
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,030
Where?

1189
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,110
Sherlock! What if there's someone in?

1190
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,830
There isn't.

1191
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,870
Jesus...

1192
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,030
- Where are we?
- Oh, sorry, didn't I say?

1193
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,630
Joe Harrison's flat.

1194
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,150
Joe...?

1195
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,230
Brother of West's fiancée.
He stole the memory stick,

1196
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,590
killed his prospective brother-in-law.

1197
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,710
Then why did he do it?

1198
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,190
Let's ask him.

1199
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,950
Don't! Don't.

1200
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,150
He wasn't meant to...

1201
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,870
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

1202
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,190
Why did you kill him?

1203
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,350
It was an accident. I swear it was.

1204
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,750
But stealing the plans
for the missile defence program

1205
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,310
wasn't an accident, was it?

1206
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,510
I started dealing drugs.

1207
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,390
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

1208
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,950
I don't know how it started.

1209
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,310
I just got out of my depth.

1210
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,790
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

1211
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,470
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

1212
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,510
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

1213
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,430
But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

1214
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,670
He told me about these missile plans.

1215
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,350
Beyond top secret.

1216
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,230
He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.

1217
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,990
You hear about these things getting lost,

1218
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,070
ending up on rubbish tips and whatnot.

1219
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,390
But there it was. And I thought...

1220
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,430
Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

1221
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,510
It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.

1222
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,310
Next time I saw him,

1223
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,630
I could tell by the look on his face
that he knew.

1224
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,630
- What are you doing here?
- What have you done with the plans?

1225
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,230
What happened?

1226
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,470
I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

1227
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,310
I just didn't have a clue what to do.

1228
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,910
So I dragged him in 'ere.

1229
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,150
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

1230
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,590
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

1231
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,150
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.

1232
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,830
His body would have gone on for ages

1233
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,910
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track with curves.

1234
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,070
- And points.
- Exactly.

1235
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,270
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

1236
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,830
Fetch it for me, if you wouldn't mind.

1237
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,270
Distraction over - the game continues.

1238
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,950
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.

1239
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,430
Five pips, remember, John.

1240
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,270
It's a countdown. We've only had four.

1241
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:21,470
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

1242
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,710
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

1243
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,990
- I knew it was dangerous.
- Hm?

1244
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,190
Getting you into crap telly.

1245
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,910
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

1246
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,950
Have you given Mycroft
the memory stick yet?

1247
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,350
Yep. He was over the moon.

1248
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,190
Threatened me with a knighthood... again.

1249
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,910
- You know, I'm still waiting.
- Hm?

1250
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,870
For you to admit that a little knowledge
of the solar system

1251
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,510
and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

1252
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,070
It didn't do you any good, did it?

1253
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,670
No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

1254
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,350
- True.
- I won't be in for tea.

1255
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,430
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still
some of that risotto left in the fridge.

1256
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,070
- Milk, we need milk.
- I'll get some.

1257
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,830
- Really?
- Really.

1258
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,710
- And some beans, then?
- Mm.

1259
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,790
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

1260
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,310
That's what it's all been for, isn't it?

1261
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,270
All your little puzzles, making me dance.

1262
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,670
All to distract me from this.

1263
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,270
Evening.

1264
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,830
This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock?

1265
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,030
- John! What the hell...?
- Bet you never saw this coming.

1266
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:16,470
What... would you like me
to make him say... next?

1267
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,390
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,

1268
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,310
- gottle o' gear.
- Stop it.

1269
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,630
Nice touch, this. The pool,

1270
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,070
where little Carl dies.

1271
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,830
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.

1272
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,710
- Stop his heart.
- Who are you?

1273
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,870
I gave you my number.

1274
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,510
I thought you might call.

1275
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,110
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,

1276
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,710
or are you just pleased to see me?

1277
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,990
Both.

1278
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,590
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

1279
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,910
Jim?

1280
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,070
Jim from the hospital?

1281
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,190
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

1282
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,590
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

1283
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,830
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.

1284
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,910
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

1285
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,470
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse

1286
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,150
of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.

1287
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,510
I'm a specialist, you see.

1288
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,150
Like you.

1289
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,710
Dear Jim...

1290
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,830
...please will you fix it for me

1291
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,150
to get rid of my lover's nasty sister?

1292
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,990
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me
to disappear to South America?

1293
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,590
Just so.

1294
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,710
Consulting criminal.

1295
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,550
- Brilliant.
- Isn't it?

1296
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,470
No-one ever gets to me.

1297
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,910
And no-one ever will.

1298
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,110
I did.

1299
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,430
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.

1300
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,230
- Thank you.
- Didn't mean it as a compliment.

1301
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,430
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah, OK, I did.

1302
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,150
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

1303
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,150
Daddy's had enough now.

1304
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,590
I've shown you what I can do.

1305
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,550
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems,

1306
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,310
even 30 million quid,
just to get you to come out and play.

1307
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,510
So take this as a friendly warning...
my dear.

1308
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,230
Back off.

1309
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,590
Although I have loved this,

1310
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,430
this little game of ours.

1311
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,470
Playing Jim from IT.

1312
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,070
Playing gay. Did you like
the little touch with the underwear?

1313
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,910
- People have died.
- That's what people do!

1314
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,710
- I will stop you.
- No, you won't.

1315
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,150
Are you all right?

1316
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,230
You can talk, Johnny boy.

1317
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,630
Go ahead.

1318
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,390
- Take it.
- Mm? Oh...

1319
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,550
...that?

1320
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,790
The missile plans.

1321
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,270
Boring!

1322
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,350
I could have got them anywhere.

1323
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:46,310
- Sherlock, run!
- Good!

1324
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,550
Very good.

1325
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,710
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

1326
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,190
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

1327
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,190
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

1328
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,070
They're so touchingly loyal.

1329
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,390
But oops!

1330
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,190
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

1331
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,030
Gotcha.

1332
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:24,190
Westwood. Do you know what happens if you
don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you?

1333
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,990
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

1334
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,470
Kill you?

1335
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,950
No, don't be obvious. I mean,
I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.

1336
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,790
I don't want to rush it, though.

1337
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,990
I'm saving it up for something special.

1338
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:43,070
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you.

1339
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,070
I'll burn the heart out of you.

1340
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,790
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

1341
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,870
But we both know that's not quite true.

1342
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:04,070
Well, I'd better be off.

1343
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,350
Well, so nice to have had a proper chat.

1344
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,230
What if I was to shoot you now?

1345
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,510
Right now?

1346
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,790
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

1347
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,590
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

1348
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,350
Really, I would.

1349
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,950
And just a teensy bit... disappointed.

1350
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,110
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

1351
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,150
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

1352
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,470
Catch you... later.

1353
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,390
No, you won't!

1354
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,230
All right? Are you all right?

1355
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,350
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

1356
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,230
Sherlock!

1357
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,470
Oh, Christ.

1358
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:20,430
- Are you OK?
- Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1359
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,830
That, er... thing that you...
that you did,

1360
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,350
that, um... you offered to do...
that was, um... good.

1361
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,830
- I'm glad no-one saw that.
- Mm?

1362
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,910
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

1363
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,030
People might talk.

1364
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,910
They do little else.

1365
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,910
- Oh...
- Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

1366
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,670
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

1367
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,470
it is my only weakness.

1368
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,350
You can't be allowed to continue.

1369
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,870
You just can't.

1370
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,470
I would try to convince you,

1371
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,390
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

1372
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,630
Probably my answer has crossed yours.
